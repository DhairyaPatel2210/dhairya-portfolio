# Portfolio Frontend - README

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Portfolio Frontend** repository! üéâ This is a ready-to-use frontend template for creating your personal portfolio. You can either use it as is or modify it to suit your needs. This frontend connects to a backend via REST APIs and utilizes data stored through an admin panel, helping you showcase your skills and unlock new opportunities.

üöÄ **Live Demo**: [dhairyapatel.me](https://dhairyapatel.me/)

## üåü Quick Deployment

### **Setup Environment Variables**

To communicate with the backend, create a `.env` file and add the following environment variables:

```env
VITE_API_KEY=//your-api-key
VITE_EMAIL=//your-email
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://dhairyapatel.me/api
VITE_PUBLIC_KEY=//your-public-key
```

üîë **How to Generate API Key & Public Key?**

1. Login to the [Admin Panel](https://admin.dhairyapatel.me).
2. Generate your API key and public key from the homepage.

## üîå Useful Backend APIs

These APIs will help you fetch portfolio data and manage your projects.

### **Authentication**

To make any request, you need to first authenticate with the backend API. Before making the API call, encrypt your `VITE_API_KEY` using your public key. See an example in [`src/lib/encryption.ts`].

#### **Authenticate with API Key**

**Endpoint:**

```http
POST https://admin.dhairyapatel.me/api/users/auth/api-key
```

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "encryptedKey": "your-encrypted-api-key",
  "email": "your-email@example.com"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "message": "Authentication successful",
  "token": "your-jwt-token",
  "user": {
    "id": "user-id",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
  }
}
```
